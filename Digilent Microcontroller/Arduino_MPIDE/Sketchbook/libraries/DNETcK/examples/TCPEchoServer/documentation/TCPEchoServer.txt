TCPEchoServer 1.0

1.  Make sure that the TCPIP Server address of 192.168.1.190:44300 will work on your network.
    If not then modify the server address in the sketch to one that will.

            /***********************************************************/
            //
            //          CHANGE THIS TO YOUR SERVER IP ADDRESS
            //
            IPv4 ipServer = {192,168,1,190};
            unsigned short portServer = 44300;    
            //
            //

2.  Compile and upload TCPEchoServer from MPIDE. Once TCPEchoServer is uploaded open the serial monitor at 9600 baud. 
    You should see something like:

            TCPEchoServer 1.0
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

            Started Listening
            Listening on port: 44300

3.  Under the ...\libraries\DNETcK\examples\TCPEchoServer\PCCode directory start TCPEchoClient.exe; this is a windows Forms application 
    so a window will automatically open.

4.  In TCPEchoClient it defaults to the same hostname IP and port as the sketch was originally coded to. However, if you 
    changed those values, change them in TCPEchoClient before proceeding.

5.  The default "Send Text" in TCPEchoClient is "Text to Echo", you may leave this as is, or change it. This documentation is 
    assuming you left it as is.

6.  The Log in TCPEchoClient should look something like:

            TCPEchoClient Version 1.0.4414.23621
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

7.  Click the Send button in TCPEchoClient and wait about 10 seconds. You should see in the serial monitor something like:

            TCPEchoServer 1.0
            Digilent, Copyright 2011

            Started Listening
            Listening on port: 44300
            Got 1 clients pending
            Got a Connection
            Got 12 bytes
            Writing: 
            Text to Echo
            Closing TcpClient

            Listening on port: 44300

8.  And in the TCPEchoClient you should see something like:

            TCPEchoClient Version 1.0.4414.23621
            Digilent, Copyright 2011
            Info: Please wait, attempting to connect to: 192.168.1.190:44300
            TX: Text to Echo
            Starting to listen
            RX: Text to Echo
            Ending listening

9.  If you hit the Send button repeatedly quickly (within a second or so; actually less than 5 seconds).  You will see a repetition 
    of the TX and RX without Start/End listening as the connection is not dropped between sends. Likewise in the serial monitor 
    you will not see the Listening on port: 44300 between the echoes as that connection is not dropped either. 

10. To close TCPEchoClient, hit the RED X.
